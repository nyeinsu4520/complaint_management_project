**Context and Problem Statement**

The CMS requires a responsive and user-friendly web interface for multiple user roles. The frontend must support form handling, role-based navigation, and communication with backend REST APIs.

**Decision Drivers**

User Experience

Component Reusability

Frontend–Backend Separation

Industry Adoption

**Considered Options**

React.js

Angular

Server-side rendered templates (e.g. Thymeleaf)

**Decision Outcome**

React.js was selected as the frontend framework.

**Rationale**

React supports component-based development, making the user interface modular and easy to maintain. Its strong ecosystem and compatibility with REST APIs make it suitable for building a modern frontend for a service-oriented backend.

**Consequences**

**Positive**

Clean separation between frontend and backend

Reusable UI components

Strong community support

**Negative**

Requires additional setup for state management

Increased complexity compared to server-rendered templates

**Relationship to System Design**

This decision is reflected in the Container diagram, where the React frontend communicates with the backend via REST APIs.
