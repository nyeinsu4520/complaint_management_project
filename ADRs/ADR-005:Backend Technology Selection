**Context and Problem Statement**

The CMS backend must expose REST APIs, enforce business rules, handle security, and interact with the database. The framework must support service-layer architecture and role-based access control.

**Decision Drivers**

Support for RESTful APIs

Security and Access Control

Service-Oriented Design Support

Developer Productivity

**Considered Options**

Java Spring Boot

Node.js (Express)

ASP.NET Core

**Decision Outcome**

Java Spring Boot was selected as the backend framework.

**Rationale**

Spring Boot provides built-in support for REST APIs, security, dependency injection, and data persistence. It supports service-layer architecture and integrates well with MySQL using Spring Data JPA.

**Consequences**

**Positive**

Strong ecosystem and tooling

Built-in security and data access support

Suitable for layered and service-oriented designs

**Negative**

Heavier framework compared to lightweight alternatives

Higher learning curve

**Relationship to System Design**

This decision is reflected in the Component and Code-level diagrams, showing controllers, services, and repositories.
